This project uses a MongoDB database and a python file designed to create, read, update and delete data from this data base. Lastly a dashboard uses these functions to display this information in a way users can use it.
The python file which implements CRUD functionality could be easily modified to use other MongoDB databases or users.
Thus file could be used by other files to create dashboards for any information a user might want to see.
Having all three of these parts makes maintaining and adapting any of these parts more simple. 
The CRUD python file was written as simple as possible so that it would be readable.

The specific database used for this project was for Grazioso Salvare.
It has information about rescued cats and dogs.
They need a way to organize information about the animals to find dogs that meet a particular set of criteria.
Having a python file that could use CRUD to access the database made organizing the information easier.
The dashboard could read the data and search for particular criteria. 
This was done by creating different filters which called the read function using certain parameters.
These parameters could be changed to find different criteria or even pull information from a different database.

Being able to pull and organize information from a large dataset is very useful for a company or organization.
This can make sorting through information a lot more efficient. 
This in turn can help a company or organization make better decisions and more quickly.
They can react faster to real time problems and be more profitable.
